## Architecture & Key Components

### Core Files

- **bot.py**  
  The central bot class, extending `AutoShardedBot` to optimize multi-guild operations. Handles command prefix resolution, plugin loading, event hooks (ready, errors, completions), and integrates the database manager. It’s the foundation upon which all features are built and coordinated.

- **db_manager.py**  
  Manages SQLite interactions, encapsulating schema setup, queries, and updates. This ensures data integrity and isolates database logic from command implementations, fostering maintainability and reliability.

- **main.py**  
  Entrypoint that initializes and launches the bot instance. Keeps startup procedures clean and focused.

- **utils.py**  
  Helper functions utilized across plugins for common tasks, promoting code reuse and clarity.

- **data.py**  
  Contains static data or configuration mappings that multiple plugins reference, supporting consistency.

- **schema.sql**  
  Defines the database schema to structure persistent storage, carefully designed to cover features like prefixes, user stats, reminders, and more.

- **waifu_list_final.json**  
  A comprehensive dataset powering the “waifu” themed plugin, enabling fun user interactions with pre-curated content.

## Privacy & Compliance

The project is committed to respecting user privacy and operates in full accordance with EU GDPR and related regulations. Key privacy-conscious design decisions include:

- **Minimal data collection:** Only essential information for bot functionality is stored, such as server settings, user levels, and command usage statistics. No personal data beyond what users voluntarily provide is kept.  
- **Secure data handling:** All persistent data is stored locally in SQLite databases without external data sharing.  
- **Transparency:** Bot commands and interactions never expose sensitive data publicly or to third parties.  
- **User control:** Users can manage their own data, such as resetting levels or removing reminders.  
- **Compliance-ready:** Code and practices align with best-practice guidelines for data protection and user consent.

This privacy foundation allows server owners and users to confidently deploy Jotaro without compromising their members’ data rights.

## Why Open Source?

Open sourcing the project invites collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. Benefits include:

- **Community-driven enhancements**: Anyone can contribute features, bug fixes, or optimizations.  
- **Transparency**: Users can audit the code for security and privacy guarantees.  
- **Customization**: Servers can tailor the bot to their exact needs by modifying or extending plugins.  
- **Learning resource**: Aspiring developers can study a real-world, scalable bot architecture.  
- **Sustainability**: Open collaboration ensures long-term project maintenance beyond individual developers.

The project exemplifies how open-source software can empower communities through shared ownership and collective expertise.
